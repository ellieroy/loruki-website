# Traversy Media - Loruki website tutorial

This is a website for a pretend cloud-hosting platform that I created by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4) by Traversy Media. It has three pages (home, features, docs) and a form, which has been deployed on Netlify. It also has a responsive design, so it looks good on both mobile and desktop.
